# ChemFlux-X
ChemFlux-X is a web based application that allows users to view, upload, comment on, and share educative contents related to the field of Chemistry. This is expected to be available to users on both desktop and mobile devices.

Background:

Some of the biggest challenges facing the field of chemistry include a lack of access to resources and information, a lack of diversity in the field, lack of funding for research, and poor industrialization majorly in third world countries, thereby, leaving us with limited opportunities. Additionally, there is a lack of public interest and awareness of chemistry, and a lack of collaboration between chemists. These challenges can make it difficult for chemists to make progress in their research and teaching which in turn has a great impact on socio-economic growth.

This project seeks to address some of those challenges outlined earlier with the development of a web based application, ChemFlux-X, for the <b>Democratization of Chemistry with a Content Sharing Web Based Application</b>.

Introduction:

Democratizing chemistry involves removing barriers to access and use of chemistry labs, tools, and knowledge. This can include making chemistry tools and information available online, providing open access to chemistry labs, encouraging collaborations between chemists, and using social media to help spread chemistry knowledge. It also involves making sure that chemists from all backgrounds are represented in the field, creating an environment that welcomes and supports diverse viewpoints, and ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to learn and use chemistry.

Project Overview:

This project is to build a web based application with CSS, HTML and JavaScript, that allows users to view, upload, comment on, and share videos. It will be available for users on both desktop and mobile devices.

The application will provide users the ability to:

- post, view, and comment on videos, music, photos, and other multimedia content. 
- to follow other users and interact with them. 
- to create groups, events, polls, and discussion forums. 
- to post news and announcements. 

Finally, the application will be built with responsive design, allowing it to be used across multiple devices. Javascript will be used to provide the interactive, such as user profiles, friending and messaging systems, and more.

In the future, I hope to include some AI features that will go into other search engine and upload recent and relevant contents in the field of chemistry automatically with credit to the original autos.
